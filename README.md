## Data guide to the UST-Global Hackathon on the 6th October 2020

### Overview
This guide provides an overview of all the data sources within the Covid-19 dataset used for the hackathon. To be used in conjuction with the associated API guides and notebooks containing examples of data innovation with the dataset.

### List of datasets within the Covid-19 dataset
All the data that collectively form our Covid-19 dataset are listed below, with sources and where and how we have enriched this data.

#### 1. Covid-19 incidence related data

#### Daily incidence rates (Local Authority level)
Reporting daily on the number of [newly recorded Covid-19 cases](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/cases) by Local Authority. This data also reports the Local Authority population size, enabling the incidence rate (typically per 10,000 or per 100,000 people) of Covid-19 to be derived.

This data can be accessed via [this API](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/cases) and a notebook with analysis examples is [here.](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/cases)

#### Daily NHS 111 and 999 Covid-19 Triage rates (Local Authority level)
NHS Digital publishes the number of NHS 111 and 999 triages for Covid-19 daily. Reporting by age and gender at a Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) level, we have attributed these figures at a Local Authority level to make them comparable with other incidence and demography data and also the business and economic metrics we outline in section 3 below.


#### 2. Population demography related data

#### 3. Industry and economy related data

#### 4. GIS data

#### 5. Other data
